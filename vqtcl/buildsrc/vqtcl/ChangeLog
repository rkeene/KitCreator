  * merge: Merged the following changes from the old repository.
      - Fixed mkcl for recent change to all branches that propagates errors
	from matchin directory functions which was breaking tclkit's based
	on vlerq vfs.
      - Updated for 8.6 changes. interp->errorLine is now replaced by
	Tcl_GetErrorLine and the stubs variables are now const. Use
	-ltclstubs for vqtcl.
      - Updated the nmake build files for MSCV9 and added a target to run
	the test suite. Fixed three tests that had unix expectations to
	pass with windows as well.
      - Applied patch from kostix to solve problems opening tclkit when
	the directory has non-ascii characters in the path. Tcl provides a
	utf-8 string and we need to convert it to the external encoding.
      - Support release build with symbols under msvc
      - For 8.6 - do not define USE_TCL_STUBS for static builds
      - add code signing support for Win32, add stdint.h for newer mingw
      - stdint.h required. Patched to permit operation on authenticode signed binaries
